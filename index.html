              <p class="text-font">
                Danger Terry was born into the brutal life of a dragon's slave. While in itself there are far worse fates but the dragon for witch his servitude was bound was the great and powerful Glazhael a vile, chaotic monster that swayed the strong willed Giants into doing his bidding. The giants, lead by the coward king Blagothkis, vented their bubbling hatred and anger for their dragon overlord on the hundreds of slaves they had amassed. Danger Terrie's parent were stolen from their home when his mother was still swollen with his beating heart. <br><br>
                 A clutch of three graced the Terrie's, but Humble and his wife Modest knew that the road, for witch, their children must tread would be long, painful, and dark. Names were appointed to the younglings, Danger, Peril, and Hazard, an ever present reminder of the life they chose not, but was thrust upon them. It hadn't been more than 4 summers before the minds of Blagothkis and his followers were infected with the doctorine preached by the cultist followers of the Dragon Queen. Now, haunted by the specture of his long dead betrothed, and a third eye always watched by the Queen of dragons in the nine hells, the coward king struck down all of Danger's kin as penitence for stealing bread from a member of the cult. A vow was made that day. One day things would change. One day this castle in the clouds will fall, the evil will be purged, and his family would be avenged. These are the words repeated by Danger every night until the sun of the future finally peaked over the horizon.
                <br><br>The saviors, the liberators, the fools. Their name was passed down through the ages of the kobold houses, along with Danger Terry, the penitent one. The saviors came swiftly and with great force, though poise and grace seemed to elude them. Knowing this was his chance for freedom Danger Terry rallied all the slaves and lead the uprizing that was catalyzed by the saviors. The dragon was slain and Blagothki's mind was free at last and his betrothed could finally rest. The saviors saw something in Danger. Maybe it was his bravery, maybe his strength, maybe his ability to sway the minds of the masses to fight. He left with them and the stories, heroism, and adventures live on in the triuphant song of a bard in a run down tavern and in the history books read by old timekeepers. I won't bore you with the details of that journey. <br><br>
                Years later Danger Terry, with no place to call home, and no kin to call family set off to right the wrongs of the world and free the trodden from the tyranny of oppression. A great deal he learned from his saviors and he keeps, to this day, remembrances of his liberators. An obsidian sword, A chest plate, engraved with a dwarvin hammer, a belt made from the woven roots given from the great tree of druid kind, a golden lyre, and a quiver that held nothing but a leather etching of two flagons of mead. <br><br>
                Danger Terrie's name would not be remembered but his deeds would be known far and wide and the name given to him on his riteous quest would be whispered in the corners of pubs and taverns all throughout Faerun. The Penitent One
